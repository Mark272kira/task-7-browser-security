# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 🎯 Objective:
To enhance browser security by identifying and removing potentially harmful or unnecessary Chrome extensions.

## 🛠 Tools Used:
- Google Chrome (Version as per local system)

## 🔍 Steps Followed:

1. **Opened the Chrome Extensions page** using: `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Reviewed all installed extensions**, checking each for:
   - Source/Publisher
   - Ratings and reviews
   - Permissions
   - Whether I use it regularly
3. **Removed the following unnecessary or suspicious extensions:**
   - ✅ Arcade Classics – A game-based extension, not security-critical.
   - ✅ OutRun Offline Game – Entertainment-based and unnecessary.
   - ✅ Pinterest Love: Pinterest Screenshot Saver++ – Required extra permissions and not used.
   - ✅ Weather Please – Added a weather feature but not essential; had limited reviews.

4. **Kept only one trusted extension:**
   - **Google Docs Offline** – A legitimate extension from Google with clear functionality and purpose.

5. **Restarted Chrome** to ensure extensions were fully removed and browser performance was stable.

6. **Did research** on how malicious extensions can:
   - Steal personal information like passwords or credit card data.
   - Inject ads or redirect search traffic.
   - Monitor browser history or clipboard data.

## 📸 Screenshots:
Screenshots before and after removal are added in the `/screenshots/` folder.

## 📚 Learning Outcome:
- Understood the risk of excessive or unverified extensions.
- Learned how to manage and review permissions in Chrome.
- Improved overall browser security posture.
